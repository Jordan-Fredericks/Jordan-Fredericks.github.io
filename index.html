                    <p>
                        My name is Jordan Fredericks, I started taking classes at FVTC in the spring of 2023, but didn't join the software development program until 
                        the spring of 2024. The main reason that I joined the software development program is because I have always been good with computers and 
                        enjoyed working with them, so a career in software dev is likely to be more enjoyable, as well as paying pretty well. In my free time I am mostly 
                        either playing games or reading, although I do watch football whenever it is in season.
